# Businessplan
 This is a Businessplan presentation, which uses D3 for visualization. It includes sankey-charts, interactive line chart, interactive  tree chart.
 
 Data for the visualizations is taken from local CSV files. If you want to run the application without errors you need to initalize a local HTTP server. A python3 example looks like this:
 
 `python -m http.server 8080`
